Problem Statement:
Create a dashboard which will allow users to analyze the exchange rates between two currencies over a period of time. Users should have the option to select weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly charts. The dashboard should also display the date on which the rate was at its peak (highest) and the date on which it was at its lowest. Users should be able to print the data in a chart. Input will be currency exchange rate dataset between a currency pair and will be provided in a file format
Use USD as Base Currency where first currency will always be USD and second currency will be variable. For instance, currency pairs could be USD/INR, USD/GBP, USD/EUR, USD/CAD etc

Abstract:

The "Currency Exchange Rate Analysis Dashboard" project offers a robust solution for users seeking to analyze and understand the historical trends of exchange rates between USD and various other currencies. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface with features such as currency pair selection, flexible time intervals (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly), and interactive charts.
Users can dynamically explore and visualize exchange rate fluctuations, with the dashboard highlighting peak and trough points for deeper insights. The project includes options for data printing/export, empowering users to extract and utilize the analyzed information for external purposes.

Technical Details:
Interactive User Interface:
HTML and CSS: Create a visually appealing and responsive user interface, providing an interactive and intuitive experience for users.

Real-Time Data Interaction:
JavaScript: Enhance the frontend with dynamic content, enabling real-time interaction and updates without requiring page reloads.

Backend Processing:
Flask: Serve as the backend framework to handle data processing, communication between frontend and machine learning components, and manage the overall application logic.

Machine Learning Analysis:
•	Machine Learning (Python): Implement machine learning algorithms to analyze historical exchange rate data, identifying peak and trough points over selected time intervals.
2.	Dynamic Charting:
•	JavaScript: Use JavaScript to dynamically update and display interactive charts based on user-selected parameters (currency pair, time interval).
3.	User Input Handling:
•	JavaScript: Manage user inputs, validate selections, and handle data filtering based on chosen currency pairs and time intervals.
4.	Security Measures:
•	Flask: Implement security measures within the Flask backend to protect sensitive data and ensure a secure application environment.
5.	Exporting Data:
•	JavaScript: Enable users to export or print the analyzed data directly from the web interface for external use or documentation.
6.	Cross-Currency Comparison:
•	JavaScript: Implement features for users to compare exchange rates between multiple currency pairs simultaneously.
7.	Responsive Design:
•	HTML and CSS: Create a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring accessibility for users on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
8.	Testing and Maintenance:
•	Flask and JavaScript: Facilitate testing and maintenance by utilizing Flask for backend testing and incorporating JavaScript for frontend testing to ensure the reliability and performance of the application.
9.	Documentation:
•	Flask and JavaScript: Use Flask for backend documentation and JavaScript for frontend documentation, providing comprehensive guidance for users on navigating and utilizing the features of the dashboard.
Features:
1.	Currency Pair Selection:
1.	Users should be able to choose the currency pair they want to analyze. The base currency will always be USD.
2.	Time Interval Selection:
1.	Provide options for users to select the time interval for analysis, such as weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly.
3.	Interactive Charts:
1.	Display interactive charts (e.g., line charts or candlestick charts) that visually represent the exchange rates over the selected time interval.
4.	Peak and Trough Information:
1.	Highlight the dates on the chart when the exchange rate was at its peak (highest) and trough (lowest).
5.	Data Printing/Export:
1.	Allow users to print or export the data used in the chart for further analysis.
6.	Data Filtering:
1.	Implement functionality to filter the dataset based on the selected currency pair and time interval.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the currency exchange rate analysis dashboard project aims to provide users with a powerful tool for understanding and visualizing the historical trends of exchange rates between USD and various other currencies. By incorporating features such as currency pair selection, flexible time intervals, interactive charts, and peak/trough identification, the dashboard offers valuable insights into the fluctuation of exchange rates over time.
